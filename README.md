### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<body>
ðŸ˜„ Rose Mormino ... she/her/hers
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX/UI design and programming basics!
ðŸ“« How to reach me: rpmormino@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm left-handed!

This Github account is for my homework assignments; I'm an online Web Design student.
The repository I created, /rpmormino, is part of an assignment to learn about Github and source code management. 
To clone a repository, I downloaded the Github desktop app, cloned the repository, and then saved it to my CTI-110 folder on my external storage device.
