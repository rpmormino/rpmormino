        <h1>My name is Rose Mormino</h1>
        <p>I am an online student at WTCC, and I am currently pursuing two certificates. I love to create art, and I spent some time this summer at my local community clay studio. Last Saturday, the 30th of September, I moved to the UK to live with my fianc√©. Fall is my favorite time of year, so I've picked an autumnal palette.<p>
